# Welcome to the Software Development Wiki!

This wiki seeks to document the Software Development practices that we consider as standards. To contribute, please respect the following guidelines:

2.  Unless previously agreed, **don't overwrite content**. If in doubt, please contact either Paul Marjoram or Nick Mancuso.

The wiki is organized in the following sections:
