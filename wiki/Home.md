# Welcome to the Software Development Wiki!

The idea of this wiki is to document the Software Development practices that we consider as standards. To contribute, please respect the following guidelines:

1.  **Keep it simple**: The home page (this page) is for general guidelines. More elaborate recommendations or examples should be provided in the specific page for each topic.

2.  Unless previously agreed, **don't overwrite content**.

And that's it! Currently, the wiki is divided into the following sections:

1.  _[Coding Standards](#coding-standards)_: Anything that has to do with coding itself, aimed at making it more readable. This includes naming variables, functions, and classes, code indenting, etc.

2.  _[Software Thinking](#software-thinking)_: Things to consider before starting to write a piece of software...

3.  _[Development Workflow](#development-workflow)_: For now, mostly focused on R, general guidelines for developing Statistical Software.

4.  _[Misc](#misc)_ 

We also have a section about our Bioghost server, which hosts information regarding
how to install and setup Unix software _[here](Bioghost-server)_.
